# Mobile App Development at SII

My very first step into the professional world!

I joined SII—a French IT services company—at the beginning of 2018. My first mission was to develop a meeting room booking app as a pre-sales project, with the goal of selling it to a client.

## Key Achievements

**Developed a Functional Prototype**

- The app was built using **Ionic** and **Angular**.
- Ionic enabled rapid cross-platform hybrid app development.
- The prototype worked seamlessly on both **Android** and **iOS** devices.
- No backend was used for this project.
- The application integrated with **Microsoft Exchange (Graph API)** for room booking functionality.

**Rapid Learning Curve**

- The main challenge was learning the entire technical stack and the mobile development ecosystem, including tools like **Android Studio** and **Xcode**.

## Technical Stack

- **Ionic**
- **Angular**
- **Microsoft Exchange (Graph API)**
- **OAuth2 Authentication**

## Results

After just one month, the prototype was fully functional and capable of booking meeting rooms.

Unfortunately, the project was discontinued for business reasons.
