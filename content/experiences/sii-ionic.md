# Mobile App development at SII

My very first step into the profesional world!

I joint SII - a French IT Services Company - at the beginig of 2018. 
My first mission was to develop a meeting room booking app.
It was a before-sale project, the final goal was to sell it to a client.

## Key achievements

**Created a working prototype**

- the app was developed in Ionic and Angular
- Ionic allows to develop cross-platform hybrid apps verry quickly
- The prototype workd on both Android and iOS devices
- For this project, I didn't use any backend. 
- The application were connected to the Azure

**Learning everything**

- The main challenge was that I had to learn everything abot the technical stack, as well as the mobile development echosystem (android studio, Ccode...)

## Technical stack

- Ionic
- Angular
- Microsoft Exchange (Graph API)
- OAuth2 authentication

## Results

After a month, the prototype was working and able to book meeting rooms.

Unfortunately, the project was abandoned for business reasons.
