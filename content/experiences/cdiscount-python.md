# Python expert for Data Science


## Achievements

- Developed python libraries to simplify connection with parts of our information system (database, observability, file storage, ...)
- Designed and developed a custom framework based on luigi to help Data Scientists to write python workflows
- Deployed Argo Workflows on Kubernetes to give Data Science teams the possibility to split their bigger workflows into multiple steps and schedule them on multiple pods on Kubernetes
- Developed an authentication library that implements OpenID Connect protocol for human-to-machine communication, and OAuth2 for machine-to-machine.
- Helped to migrate all Data Science python algorithms to Snowflake. I took advantage of this migration to refactor most of the python projects.
- Deployed a Jupyterhub server on Kubernetes. The users (Data Scientists) can connect securely to their own notebook session.
  Each session starts a dedicated pod with custom resources allocation on Kuberntes.
  A robust authentication system based on Keycloak is in place to prevent unauthorized access to the notebooks.
- Created and animated training sessions for Data Scientists on CICD
- Created an ephemeral-storage metric exporter for Kubernetes
- Optimized the performance of some of the python batch jobs, identifying bottlenecks and implementing optimizations (better batching, using faster libraries or algorithms...).
