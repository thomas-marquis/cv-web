# Python expert for Data Science

## Achievements

**🛠 Python libraries development**

Developed python libraries to simplify connection with parts of our information system (database, observability, file storage, ...)

**🧰 Framework development**

Designed and developed a custom framework based on luigi to help Data Scientists to write python workflows

**🧩 Argo Workflows**

- Deployed Argo Workflows on Kubernetes to give Data Science teams the possibility to split their bigger workflows into multiple steps and schedule them on multiple pods on Kubernetes

**🔑 Security and authentication**

- Developed an authentication library that implements OpenID Connect protocol for human-to-machine communication, and OAuth2 for machine-to-machine.

**❄️ Snowflake migration**

- Helped to migrate all Data Science python algorithms to Snowflake. I took advantage of this migration to refactor most of the python projects.

**🪐 Jupyterhub**

- Deployed a Jupyterhub server on Kubernetes. The users (Data Scientists) can connect securely to their own notebook session.
  Each session starts a dedicated pod with custom resources allocation on Kuberntes.
  A robust authentication system based on Keycloak is in place to prevent unauthorized access to the notebooks.

**👩‍🏫 CICD training**
- Created and animated training sessions for Data Scientists on CICD

**📏 Metrics exporter**
- Created an ephemeral-storage metric exporter for Kubernetes

**🧶 Optimizations**
- Optimized the performance of some of the python batch jobs, identifying bottlenecks and implementing optimizations (better batching, using faster libraries or algorithms...).


**📦 Docker images**
Developed standard internal Docker images for all python versions, managed the version lifecycle and built the pipeline to rebuild images on a regular basis.
