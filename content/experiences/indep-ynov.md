# YNOV Campus – Self-Employed Missions

Alongside my professional activities, I work as a self-employed consultant for **[YNOV Campus](https://www.ynov.com/campus/bordeaux)**, an engineering school in Bordeaux.

I have undertaken several missions, a few times a year, including:

- Serving as a **member of the evaluation panel** for the school’s final exams in:
  - Web Development
  - DevOps
  - Data Science
- Developing an **automated Python course** (similar to CodingGame)

## Member of the Evaluation Panel

Several times a year, I participate in the evaluation panel for final exams. My role involves assessing students' work based on their oral presentations, dissertations, and codebases.

I evaluate their projects using an official criteria grid, for instance:
- **Technical design choices**
- **Code quality**
- **Testing**

During these evaluations, I review a wide range of projects written in various programming languages, such as **PHP, Node.js, and Java**.

## Automated Python Course

YNOV Campus offers students an **e-learning platform** where they can learn programming languages through interactive exercises. 
An automated system verifies the correctness of their work.

I was tasked with:
- **Designing a comprehensive course for Python** with progressively increasing difficulty
- **Creating exercises and solutions**
- **Writing automated tests** to validate student submissions
