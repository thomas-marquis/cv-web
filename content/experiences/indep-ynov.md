# YNOV Campus - Self-Employed Missions

Alongside my regular occupation, I also work as a self-employed missionary for an engineering school in Bordeaux, **[YNOV Campus](https://www.ynov.com/campus/bordeaux)**.

I have conducted punctual missions, a few times per year, such as:

- Member of the evaluation panel for the engineering school's final exam for the following subjects:
  - Web development
  - Devops
  - Data Science
- Building an automated Python course (in a style of Coding Game)

## Member of the evaluation panel

Multiple times per year, I am part of the evaluation panel. 
I have to evaluate the students' work, according to their oral presentation, their dissertation and their codebase.

I evaluate students' work according to an official criteria grid.
Some of the skills I have to assess are:
- Technical design choices
- Code quality
- Testing
- etc.

During these evaluations, I have to read a lot of different projects written in many different languages (usually, PHP, Node and Java).

## Automated Python course

YNOV provides to their students an e-learning platform, where it is possible to learn a programming language with interactive exercises.
An automated system assure the correctness of the students' work.

YNOV tasked me to develops the exercises, and to write the automated tests for the python programming language.
My tasks were:
- Design a full course with a smoothly growing difficulty
- Write the exercise and solutions
- Write the automated tests
