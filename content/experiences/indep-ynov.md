# YNOV Campus - Self-Employed Missions

Alongside my regular occupation, I also work as a self-employed missionary for an engineering school in Bordeaux, **[YNOV Campus](https://www.ynov.com/campus/bordeaux)**.

I have conducted punctual missions, a few times per year, such as:

- Member of the evaluation panel for the engineering school's final exam
- Building an automated Python course (in a style of Coding Game)

## Member of the evaluation panel

Multiple times per year, I have been part of the evaluation panel. I have to evaluate the students' work, according to their oral presentation and their dissertation.

## Automated Python course

YNOV provides to their students an e-learning platform, where it is possible to learn a programming language with interactive exercises.
An automated system assure the correctness of the students' work.

YNOV tasked me to develops the exercises, and to write the automated tests for the python programming language.
My tasks were:
- Design a full course with a smoothly growing difficulty
- Write the exercise and solutions
- Write the automated tests
