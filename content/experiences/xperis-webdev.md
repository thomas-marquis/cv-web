title: "Web developer at Xperis (six-month internship)"
weight: 10
skills:
  - name: Java
    details: |
      The entire project backend was written in Java.
  - name: Struts 2
    details: |
      Struts 2 is a Java framework that allows to create web applications.
      The existing code was written using this framework.
  - name: JavaScript
    details: |
      Since Struts 2 is a server-side rendered web framework, the frontend needed some JS for more complex interactions.
      No framework were used for the frontend, just vanilla JS and JQery. 
      (I spent hours on [this website](https://caniuse.com/), does this bring back memories?)
  - name: JQuery
  - name: D3js
    details: |
      I used D3js to create interactive charts and graphs.
      I have bench-marked several libraries and found D3js to be the most suitable for this project because of its flexibility and infinite possibilities.
  - name: CSS
  - name: Cloverleaf EAI
    details: |
      EAI stands for Enterprise Application Integration.
      It is a software architecture that allows different applications to communicate with each other.
      Cloverleaf is an commercial EAI solution provided by an US company specialized for hospitals.
  - name: R
    details: |
      Despite R was not needed for this project, I choose to use it to conduct data analysis on Cloverleaf metrics during the exploratory phase of the project.
  - name: Subversion
    details: |
      Historically, Xperis used SVN for version control.
      Thus, I had to learn how to use SVN in order to contribute to the project.
  - name: Vertx
    details: |
      Vertx is a Java framework that allows to create reactive applications.
      I used it to create a RESTful API for Cloverleaf metrics.
      This API server were hosted on the Cloverleaf server and was responsible to collect metrics and expose them to the main application backend.
  - name: SQLite
    details: |
      SQLite is the default database where Cloverleaf stored the metrics.
      The Vertx API server got connected to this database to retrieve them.
  - name: User interviews
    details: |
      I conducted user interviews with the project's users to understand their needs.
      These interviews helped me to define the project's requirements and backlog.
  - name: Needs analysis
  - name: TDD
    details: |
      The existing code didn't contain any unit tests.
      I had to write unit tests for the new features I was implementing.
      Then, I implemented most of the features using TDD.
  - name: Independent work
    details: |
      I was the only developer on this project.
  - name: Technical conception
    details: |
      For this internship, I had to design the technical architecture myself.
      My main constraint was to adapt my technical choices to the project's requirements and constraints.
